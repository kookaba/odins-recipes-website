    <h1>Blåbärssoppa Recipe</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Swedish blueberry soup is traditionally made with bilberries, sometimes called European blueberries.<br> Blueberry soup is the most popular beverage on Sweden’s longest ski marathon, every first Sunday of March.  Almost every skier carries a vacuum flask of blåbärssoppa with them.<br></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blueberries</strong> - you can use fresh or frozen blueberries.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - regular white sugar is excellent for this blueberry soup recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> - just use your favorite brand; to thicken the soup a bit.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream</strong> - you can use light cream or heavy cream.  Just whip it for a few minutes, then place at least a dollop on your blueberry soup when serving.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start preparing your blåbärssoppa by combining the blueberries with sugar and one and a half cups of water in a medium-sized saucepan.</li>
        <li>Set on medium-high heat, cover with a lid, and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Adjust heat to low and simmer for ten to fifteen minutes, or until the blueberries turned soft.</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Take the saucepan out of the heat and use an immersion blender to puree some or all of the blueberries.</li>
        <li>Using a small bowl, combine and mix cornstarch with one tablespoon of cold water.</li>
        <li>Place the saucepan back on the heat and slowly pour the cornstarch and water mix.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring your blåbärssoppa until it thickens; adjust the taste at this point as well.</li>
        <li>Take the pan off the heat and transfer the soup into serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Place a dollop of whipped cream on top of your blueberry soup, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot or cold.</li>
    </ol>
